<h2> About Jai Hirsch</h2>

<p>
I work as a Systems Architect for Data Technologies at <a href="http://www.carfax.com/entry.cfx">CARFAX</a>, an industry-leading company in vehicle-history reports. 
I started writing software in 1995, creating interactive, text-based role playing games (telnet deepertrouble.org 4242).
I have been writing JVM-based data transformations and batch services since 2006. 
The past few years I have focused on high-volume MongoDB implementations using 
distributed processing through AMQP.  
</p>
<p>
I was one of the lead engineers to convert the CARFAX vehicle-history database from a legacy distributed key value store on OpenVMS 
to a twelve-billion-record, ten-terabyte MongoDB instance that is replicated to multiple datacenters and grows more than a billion records annually.
